/*
 * /sbin/launchd of the small image, when the kernel starts from it (rd=md0 is the small image, no
 * system image in memory): the first program the kernel runs, for a root read from the phone's
 * storage as it is needed.
 *
 * The iOS system volume is the Android DSU image on the phone's storage (tools/dada-dsu.sh), which
 * the loader serves block by block as the partition "dsu" (ufs=2; the kernel's /dev/ufs_dsu,
 * bsd/dev/redwood_ufs.c): only what is read comes off the storage, so the system can be as big as
 * the DSU slot (15 GiB) instead of what fits in the kernel's memory window. This program mounts that
 * volume read only on /flash, makes it the root -- this image goes to /redwood, where the system
 * volume has the directory stage0 mounts it on otherwise (src/stage0.c) -- and runs init from there,
 * as stage0 does: from then on all is as in a boot from the system image in memory.
